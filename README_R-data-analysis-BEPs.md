1. In the upstream repository [WWM-housinggame-data-analysis/R-data-analysis-BEPs](https://github.com/WWM-housinggame-data-analysis/R-data-analysis-BEPs), create a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) of (i.e. a copy of) this repository in your own Github account.
If that is done, make sure your Github fork repository is updated in the Github webpage by clinking on [Sync Fork -> Update Branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork#syncing-a-fork-branch-from-the-web-ui)

2. If you do not have yet a local copy of your Github fork repository, [clone your fork repository in your own machine](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#cloning-your-forked-repository).

3. If you did that already, make sure your local fork is updated by running `git pull` in your terminal inside the main folder of thr local fork `R-data-analysis-BEPs/`.

5. Inside the main folder of your local fork, create a subfolder where your code should be stored, e.g. `mkdir scripts_studentname/`

6. Copy to `R-data-analysis-BEPs/scripts_studentname/` the content found within `R-data-analysis-BEPs/Scripts_vjcortesa/`

7. If you reuse one of the scripts copied from  `Scripts_vjcortesa/`, rename the copied version in `scripts_studentname/` by adding your name to the script name. Do not rename or modify any file within `Scripts_vjcortesa/`.

8. To save the changes to be stored in the Github fork, run the following commands in the terminal:
```
git pull
git status
git add .
git commit -m "tell what you did"
git push
```

7. If the changes you did are now saved in your Github fork repository, and if you want to update the upstream repositoryu [WWM-housinggame-data-analysis/R-data-analysis-BEPs](https://github.com/WWM-housinggame-data-analysis/R-data-analysis-BEPs) with those changes, you can do so by doing a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to push the changes from your fork to ([WWM-housinggame-data-analysis/R-data-analysis-BEPs](https://github.com/WWM-housinggame-data-analysis/R-data-analysis-BEPs)).
