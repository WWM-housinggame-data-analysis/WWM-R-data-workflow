1. In [WWM-housinggame-data-analysis/R-data-analysis-BEPs](https://github.com/WWM-housinggame-data-analysis/R-data-analysis-BEPs), create a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) of (copy) this repository in your own Github account.
If that is done, make sure your fork repository is updated by clinking on Sync Fork -> Update Branch

2. Download local copy of your fork repository in your own machine with `git clone`. If you did that already, make sure the local copy is updated with `git pull`.

3. In the main folder of your local repository copy, create a folder where your code should be stored, e.g. `scripts_studentname/`

4. Copy to `scripts_studentname/` the content found within `Scripts_vjcortesa\`

5. If you reuse one of the scripts copied from  `Scripts_vjcortesa\`, rename the copied version in `scripts_studentname/` by adding your name to the script name. Do not rename or modify any file within `Scripts_vjcortesa\`.

6. To update your fork repository with your changes, run the following commands in the terminal:

'''
git add .
git commit -m "tell what you did"
git push
'''

7. Assuming that the changes you did are now saved in your forked repository, and in case you want to update the [WWM-housinggame-data-analysis/R-data-analysis-BEPs](https://github.com/WWM-housinggame-data-analysis/R-data-analysis-BEPs), you can do so by doing a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to push the changes in your forked repository to the "upstream" repository.
